## Purpose
The ability for a data analyst to clean, structure and load data into a usable format is critical. This project is a deep dive into just that, utalizing the ETL process for the company "Amazing Prime."
Amazing Prime is hosting a hackathon and our goal was to gather movie data from both Wikipeadia and Kaggle for Amazing Prime to host this event. To then make that data accessible by loading it into a SQL database.

### Below are excerpts to highlighting examples of the code used to clean the data.
